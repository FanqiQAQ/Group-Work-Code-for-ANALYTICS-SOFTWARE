# Group-Work-Code-for-ANALYTICS-SOFTWARE
In our group assignment, we utilized a dataset from Kaggle on bank loan credit evaluation. My main task was to model and optimize the results, and then evaluate and visualize the results. This section uses the xgboost model to process high-dimensional data (170 labels) and ultra large samples (sample size 750000).
R codes provided as XGBoost.R and the trained model can be directly loaded by the model document xgboost_model.model
